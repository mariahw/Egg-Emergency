Egg Emergency - Game Mechanics - V1

This project is a game study of the gameplay for the mini-game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iVIh9aWrH0" target="_blank">"Egg Emergency"</a> - featured in the Nintendo 2000 published title "Pokemon Stadium 2"

## Pseudo-Code

Conceptually - the game functions around collision detection determined by a dropping "token" or "bomb" sprite, and a barrier that renders the collision per the user input at time of collision.

Using the Phaser framework, I have re-created the fundumentals of the gameplay.
